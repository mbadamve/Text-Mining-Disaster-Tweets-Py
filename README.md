# Extracting, exploring, summarizing information from Twitter social media, aggregated news during disasters

## Project Description:  

In this research project, the goal is to extract information from tweets posted on Twitter social media during disasters and provide knowledge extracted to the organizations, charities and in turn, help them take decisions about disaster recovery. Also, the information extraction process can be automated and will be discussed in the future scope of this research work.  On a higher level, this is made possible by the use of powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms like BERT and using word embeddings from Word2Vec algorithm.
